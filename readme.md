# Project details
```
Build a simple and efficient scraping system that accepts the URL of a specific website and scrapes a list 
of items with price. The system should also be able to scrap data if there are paginations. The result 
must be stored in the MongoDB database collection. Data imported from multiple web pages should 
match the standard database columns and structure. It would be best if you kept the web page URL so it 
could be configured and updated. The application should return the status after finishing or any issue 
with the process. Assume that your app will run on a very low configuration machine
